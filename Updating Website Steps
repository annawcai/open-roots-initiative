Every time you update your website:

1️⃣ Open Terminal
(Not VS Code editor — the Terminal at the bottom or your system terminal.)

2️⃣ Make sure you're inside your project folder
If needed:
cd open-roots-initiative
You should see src, package.json, etc if you type:
ls

3️⃣ Then paste:
git add .
git commit -m "Updated site"
git push

Press Enter after each line (or paste all three at once).
That uploads your changes to GitHub → which triggers Vercel to update your live site
